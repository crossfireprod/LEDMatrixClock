# LEDMatrixClock
Weekend project to make something useful out of two RGB LED matrices I had laying around.  The matrices are mounted back to back to serve as a clock / generic information display in the [Resica Falls Scout Reservation STEM Center](https://resicafalls.org/programs-and-opportunities).
